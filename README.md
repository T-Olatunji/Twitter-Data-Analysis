# Twitter-Data-Analysis
The dataset that we wrangled in this project is the tweet archive of the Twitter user @dog_rates also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings always almost have a denominator of 10.
# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to effectively wrangle (i.e. gather, assess and clean) the WeRateDogs Twitter data in order to create worthy analyses and visualizations.
